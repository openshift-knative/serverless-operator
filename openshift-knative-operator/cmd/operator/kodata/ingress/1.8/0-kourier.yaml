    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # ingress-class specifies the default ingress class
    # to use when not dictated by Route annotation.
    #
    # If not specified, will use the Istio ingress.
    #
    # Note that changing the Ingress class of an existing Route

    # update this value during the setup of Knative, to avoid getting
    # undefined behavior.
    ingress-class: "istio.ingress.networking.knative.dev"

    # If not specified, will use the Cert-Manager Certificate.
    #
    # Note that changing the Certificate class of an existing Route

    certificate-class: "cert-manager.certificate.networking.knative.dev"

    # namespace-wildcard-cert-selector specifies a LabelSelector which

    # provisioned.
    #
    # Use an empty value to disable the feature (this is the default):
    #   namespace-wildcard-cert-selector: ""

    # "networking.knative.dev/disableWildcardCert" to exclude namespaces:

    #   operator: "NotIn"
    #   values: ["true"]
    namespace-wildcard-cert-selector: ""

    # domain-template specifies the golang text template string to use
    # when constructing the Knative service's DNS name. The default
    # value is "{{.Name}}.{{.Namespace}}.{{.Domain}}".
    #
    # Valid variables defined in the template include Name, Namespace, Domain,
    # Labels, and Annotations. Name will be the result of the tagTemplate
    # below, if a tag is specified for the route.
    #
    # Changing this value might be necessary when the extra levels in
    # the domain name generated is problematic for wildcard certificates
    # that only support a single level of domain name added to the
    # certificate's domain. In those cases you might consider using a value
    # of "{{.Name}}-{{.Namespace}}.{{.Domain}}", or removing the Namespace
    # entirely from the template. When choosing a new value be thoughtful
    # of the potential for conflicts - for example, when users choose to use
    # characters such as `-` in their service, or namespace, names.
    # {{.Annotations}} or {{.Labels}} can be used for any customization in the
    # go template if needed.
    # We strongly recommend keeping namespace part of the template to avoid
    # domain name clashes:
    # eg. '{{.Name}}-{{.Namespace}}.{{ index .Annotations "sub"}}.{{.Domain}}'
    # and you have an annotation {"sub":"foo"}, then the generated template
    # would be {Name}-{Namespace}.foo.{Domain}

    # of Routes and Configuration.  This is used in conjunction with the
    # domainTemplate above to determine the full URL for the tag.
