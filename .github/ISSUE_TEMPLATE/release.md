# Release Checklist

## Resources
- https://github.com/openshift-knative/serverless-operator/blob/main/README.md#create-a-new-version
- [Video](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1j1KF_1dUl6x0oiN2aVKlapAYXo1dGUDG) from pierdipi showing the release process

## Pre-checks
- [ ] Check if the OCP versions in the [release-matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HTxR37_MM03_JQImW-KmAFk1oEQ83fXzfGxdfWQSX6o/edit#gid=0) match [our current CI config](https://github.com/openshift-knative/hack/tree/main/config). If not, fix the versions first
- [ ] Check if there are open PRs for Serverless-Operator that need to be merged
- [ ] Check with the teams if they have all the necessary patches in the dependent repositories
- [ ] [Run the `validate` action in `serverless-operator` and wait for it to complete](https://github.com/openshift-knative/serverless-operator/actions/workflows/validate.yaml)
- [ ] [Merge PRs created by GitHub actions](https://github.com/openshift-knative/serverless-operator/pulls/app%2Fgithub-actions)
- [ ] Make sure that Serverless-Operator CI and periodics are passing. Check for example the periodic jobs in [#serverless-ci](https://redhat.enterprise.slack.com/archives/CHTTRCUBC) 

## Cutting the new release branch
- [ ] Create a new branch from `main` with the pattern `release-x.xx`
- [ ] [Approve CI setup for `release-1.X` branch in `openshift/release`](https://github.com/openshift/release/pulls/serverless-qe) and wait for the PR to be merged.
- [ ] [Only for release-1.35+] [Revoke and recreate the token for the Konflux auto apply workflow](https://github.com/openshift-knative/hack/tree/main/cmd/konflux-apply#revoke-and-recreate-token)
- [ ] [Only for release-1.35+] [Approve PRs created by `serverless-qe` bot in `hack`](https://github.com/openshift-knative/hack/pulls/serverless-qe)
  - [ ] wait for the PR to be merged
  - [ ] wait for the [Generate CI config workflow to succeed](https://github.com/openshift-knative/hack/actions/workflows/release-generate-ci.yaml?query=event%3Apush++)
  - [ ] [Approve Konflux-related PRs created by `serverless-qe`](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+author%3Aserverless-qe+archived%3Afalse+%22Konflux%22) and wait for the PR to be merged.
  - [ ] Wait for the PRs to be merged
  - [ ] [Approve PRs created by GitHub actions bot in `serverless-operator`](https://github.com/openshift-knative/serverless-operator/pulls/app%2Fgithub-actions)
- [ ] Verify that [`knative-istio-authz-chart`](https://github.com/openshift-knative/knative-istio-authz-chart/branches) has a branch with the same name as the `release-1.X` branch created previously in   serverless-operator
- [ ] Verify that [`knative-istio-authz-chart`'s `Chart.yaml`](https://github.com/openshift-knative/knative-istio-authz-chart/blob/main/Chart.yaml) has `version` and `appVersion` set to the next version.

## Monitor Build Status

Once the `serverless-operator` branch is cut and PRs related to the release we're releasing are in,
Konflux pipelines will run (if they haven't already) and build the various artifacts.
You can check their aggregated status using the
[Build Status Dashboard](https://openshift-knative.github.io/hack/).

### Pre-checks
- [ ] Make sure that all dependent repos have a release branch for the new version and [CI set up](https://github.com/openshift-knative/hack)
- [ ] Make sure that the [automated PR to point the CSV to the old branch is merged](https://github.com/openshift-knative/serverless-operator/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aapp%2Fgithub-actions+release-+is%3Aopen) like in https://github.com/openshift-knative/serverless-operator/pull/1881

### Serving Manifests
- [ ] Bump versions of `serving`, `serving_artifacts_branch`, `kourier`, `net_kourier_artifacts_branch`, `net_istio` and `net_istio_artifacts_branch`  [here](https://github.com/openshift-knative/serverless-operator/blob/main/olm-catalog/serverless-operator/project.yaml#L34)
- [ ] Run `make generated-files` and send a PR

### Eventing Manifests
- [ ] Bump versions of `eventing*`  [here](https://github.com/openshift-knative/serverless-operator/blob/main/olm-catalog/serverless-operator/project.yaml#L34)

- [ ] Run `./hack/update-deps.sh --upgrade`

- [ ] Send a PR with the changes
- [ ] Pray that it works ðŸ˜¸  Otherwise try bump in steps and/or find a dependency version mix (with `go mod replace`) that works
