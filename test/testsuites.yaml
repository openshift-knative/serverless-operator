# Select test suites to be run. This list is used together with Git diff.
# run_if_changed defines path expressions (regexp) and associated test suites to be run
# if those paths are changed.

# A testsuite without "tests" element defines path expressions that don't require
# any tests to be run on change.

# Each path in the Git diff is checked against all "run_if_changed" regular expressions.
# If the path matches any of the expressions then all tests from that testsuite are added
# to the list of tests to be run.
# If the path doesn't match any expression in any testsuite then it's an unknown
# change with a potentially high impact and all tests should run.
